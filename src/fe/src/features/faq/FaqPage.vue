      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When a new pathogen emerges, there is no mechanism trusted by all MS
          to rapidly share materials in the very early stages of an outbreak.
        </li>
        <li>
          Existing initiatives to advance science and research are limited in
          geographic scope and rapidity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sharing of pathogens needs to account for all applicable rules and
          regulations – including biosafety and biosecurity – and ensure an
          approach that maintains trust throughout for all MS and the public
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p id="P2"><b>2. Why do we need a global system?</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A lesson that keeps emerging, especially with novel pathogens
          outbreaks and epidemics, is the need to rapidly and broadly share
          pathogens for effective surveillance and the timely development of
          diagnostics and other medical countermeasures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Currently there are different schemes that either involve already
          identified pathogens, or sharing is done bilaterally or on an ad hoc
          basis.
        </li>
        <li>
          So, there is no established, trusted global system that can kick
          immediately into gear and make sure that when a new pathogen emerges,
          countries can pro-actively contribute to public health, regardless of
          the nature of the pathogen.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p id="P3"><b>3. What is the end-goal/ solution?</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A trusted and transparent, global, end-to-end system that:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            that works across laboratories and partners to quickly characterize,
            sequence, and carry out necessary and risk assessments and other
            critical public health actions.
          </li>
          <li>
            works across countries and regions to facilitate the rapid
            development of diagnostics and medical countermeasures and their
            equitable availability to all countries based on public health
            needs.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          The System will be voluntary and will supplement existing WHO networks
          of laboratories and other related arrangements
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
          Facilitate rapid access to such pathogens and their information by
          relevant, interested, and qualified entities for the development of

      <p id="P5"><b>5. What is the approach to reach the end-goal?</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>It will consist of a phased approach:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Phase I: ‘Proof-of-concept’/Piloting the WHO BioHub System (Mar. -

            </li>
            <li>
              the first WHO BioHub Facility will be able to receive from Member
              States, on a voluntary basis, samples of SARS COV-2 variants of
              concern (e.g. 20I/501Y.V1, 20H/501Y.V2, 20J/501Y.V3, B.1.617).

            <li>
              the first Facility will receive, store, grow, sequence, and
              distribute materials, as possible and subject to the availability
              of materials and funds and in accordance with standard Terms of
              Reference developed by WHO.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Phase II: Expanding the WHO BioHub System to partners and other
            pathogens (Q1 2022)
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>A broader System will be developed in Phase II.</li>
            <li>
              It will consist of sharing of both public health benefits (e.g.
              risk assessments and analyses) but add additional benefits such as
              medical countermeasures, as well as other products arising from
              access to WHO BioHub materials.
            </li>
            <li>
              Terms and conditions applicable to qualified entities that receive
              and use WHO BioHub materials and information will be developed for
              these non-commercial purposes
            </li>
            <li>
              In this stage the WHO BioHub will aim to strengthen partnerships
              by connecting with existing repositories or laboratory networks
              and gradually expanding its scope to other pathogens with epidemic
              or pandemic potential, allowing broader scientific research and
              growth into a more robust system.

          <li>Phase III: as needed</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p id="P6"><b>6. Why this phased approach?</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          WHO is taking this approach to make sure that it is not only building
          a solution, but it is a robust, trustworthy venture, relying on
          standardised documentation. Therefore, the first phase is seen as an
          opportunity to apply best practices and use the SARS-COV-2 as a
          test-case. This does not override other important initiatives that
          exist or are being developed.
        </li>
        <li>
          While this is a voluntary endeavour, it is important to create
          momentum for a solution that will work equally for developing
          countries that are also concerned about scientific recognition and
          access and benefit considerations
        </li>
        <li>
          A Phased approach will enable WHO to consult with and gather input
          from MS and partners as it proceeds in a stepwise manner.

            To enable an effective public health response, the end-to-end system

        stress the importance of appropriately acknowledging the contributions
        of collaborators to the WHO BioHub System. To the extent possible,
        entities using BMEPP in scientific research projects will seek the

          Clinical samples and specimens mean materials taken from humans or
          animals, in as far as the samples taken from animals are shared by
          originating countries/laboratories with the WHO BioHub Facility. These
          include specimens collected from the respiratory tract (for example,
          swabs and aspirated fluid) or other parts of the body, including
          blood, serum, plasma, faeces, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and

          The WHO BioHub System is envisaged as a global public health system
          that would benefit all countries. It is therefore proposed that all
          countries have access to benefits generated from it, and where
          benefits are limited, that they be made available on the basis of
          public health need.

        </li>
        <li>
          Global public health is advanced by shaping a system that encourages
          all countries to rapidly react to what could evolve into a pandemic
          situation, and accelerates response actions, including those that
          promote public health and social measures, and facilitate development
          of needed diagnostics and medical countermeasures

          predictable and reliable pathways towards accessing BMEPP
        </li>
        <li>
          While different access-benefit sharing schemes could be developed,

      <ul>
        <li>
          The project is structured around two workstreams and two phases. This
          approach is proposed as the immediate activities are thought to
          provide lessons on proof of concept and operational progress for
          sharing in view of non-commercial public health use.
        </li>
        <li>
          At HQ, WHO has repurposed, an inclusive and crosscutting team of
          dedicated experts with selected expertise spanning:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Epidemics and pandemic preparedness and response</li>
          <li>
            Developing, coordinating and leading global laboratory networks and
            global sharing of viruses
          </li>
          <li>
            Legal expertise, with a long track record in global benefit-sharing
            agreements and complex international negotiations

        <li>
          When considering work with participating labs and other partners, work
          is starting towards developing corresponding SOPs. These will build on
          best practices that WHO is registering from a variety of projects –
          including influenza, yellow fever, COVID and others. The SOPs will
          likely address the receipt, processing, characterization (by a variety
          of means, including genetic sequencing), amplification in culture,
          aliquoting, labelling, cryopreservation (and, as necessary, validation
          of the concentration, purity, and other characteristics of the
          cryopreserved product), and forward shipping of that product. The
          shipping SOPs will have to be aligned with the shipping company – WHO
          already has such documentation and will work with partners to adapt it
          for this project.

        <li>These are to be developed in consultation with MS.</li>
        <li>
          As with most WHO projects, we envision the need for a WHO Secretariat
          that will represent a technical level, responsible for day to day
          running of operations as well as performing the necessary analysis and
          preparations to facilitate System design activities. It has functions
          pertaining to coordination, organization, communication, data
          collection (to enable decision-making as well as monitoring and
          evaluation) and reporting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Currently the project has been benefiting from a WHO Senior Steering
          Committee formed by the WHO DG, WHE EXD and WHO Chief Scientist.
        </li>
        <li>
          A foreseeable Advisory/ Decision-making body may be needed in case
          demand outstrips supply when it comes to sample sharing – meaning
          there is a large number of request to obtain samples from the WHO
          BioHub Facility which would exceed the pace that the Facility can
          serve demands. This body would be asked to advise on prioritization of
          requests in such situations with the hope that as time goes by all
          requests by qualified entities could be met as soon as possible.

          In a first phase the major costs are associated with international
          transport of samples. To facilitate a rapid operationalization and the
          need for coordination with the Swiss Lab, and the fact that the first
          phase will focus on COVID-19 sample sharing, funding that was
          fundraised for this response will be disbursed appropriately.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is to be determined how qualified entities may support the future
          running of the project.
        </li>
        <li>

          occurred early March, followed by another one in April.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the operationalisation aspects of the first stage of
          proof-of-concept, a closer engagement will be needed with the
          countries that expressed interest in engaging in the pilot/phase I
          stage. Therefore, the hosting country for the first Lab in the BioHub
          and the countries that flagged they wish to send samples are asked to
          liaise with WHO more closely in view of these proof-of-concept first
          shipments
